# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero Learning Project

This is a learning project following Andrej Karpathy's ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) course.

## Project Description

This project focuses on reimplementing the neural network code explained in the course to better understand the fundamental concepts and implementation details of neural networks.

## Course Content

The course covers the following main topics:

- Implementation of backpropagation using micrograd
- Building makemore
- TBD

## Project Structure

Code implementations for each lesson will be organized in separate folders with corresponding documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain deep understanding of neural network fundamentals
- Master neural network implementation techniques
- Improve deep learning programming skills
